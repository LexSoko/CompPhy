# SSH
[link to ssh guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30202642/how-can-i-clone-a-private-gitlab-repository/50079018#50079018)

keep in mind, that for this project you have to use `gitlab.tugraz.at` instead of `gitlab.com`.

Also following command may get you a timeout error, in this case proceed to git cloning\
```console
> ssh -i $PWD/.ssh/id_rsa git@gitlab.tugraz.at
```

PS.: `$PWD` stands for your local user directory


# Git
clone the project:
```console
> git clone https://gitlab.tugraz.at/<your_gitlab_username>/<gitlab_project_name>.git
```


# Anaconda3 useage
make sure you added following paths to your System PATH:
```{Anaconda_Install_Dir}\Anaconda3\pkgs\```
```{Anaconda_Install_Dir}\Anaconda3\Scripts```
```{Anaconda_Install_Dir}\Anaconda3\Library\bin```

when using the `conda` command in any terminal (cmd.exe, powershell, bash) make sure you first initialised conda for the specific shell with following command(conda will ask you to do that, when you try to do any conda commands):
```console
> conda init <shell_name>
```

```
install package with specific version from specific channel (some packages are not available under default channel but have to be installed from conda-forge channel)
```console
> conda install <package_name>
```

export conda environment
```console
> conda env export > environment.yml
```
import conda env from .yml file
```console
> conda env create -f environment.yml
```
verify with 
```console

```
update conda environment from environment.yml
```console
